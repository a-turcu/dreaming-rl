Reward performance:
1. Breakout score benchmark: How good should the agent be?
2. Lowered experience memory replay -> helped with training time, maybe worse score?

Peregrine:
1. Lots of memory usage -> bad algorithm design or normal? 50GB -> 26h
2. Any way of showing progress while running?

GAN:
1. Which GAN should I choose?
2. Latent dim size?
3. How much data for training? (19800 current frames)
4. Output shape bug (wrong input shape)
